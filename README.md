# Background #
As you know, China is a "magical" country! The govenment made a firewall named by Great Firewall(**GFW**), the purpose of the GFW is to block some website such as twitter.com, facebook.com and so on.  

One of the method of GFW is DNS poisoning, while this project is to avoid the DNS poisoning. 
 
# About #
This project use python script, but I just have a little skill with python, so the main script is based on [henices/Tcp-DNS-proxy](https://github.com/henices/Tcp-DNS-proxy "henices/Tcp-DNS-proxy").

If you are not a pythoner, maybe you can try my another project [isayme/fuck_dns](https://github.com/isayme/fuck_dns "isayme/fuck_dns") which is also associated with DNS poisoning.
